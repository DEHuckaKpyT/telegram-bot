/**
 * Created on 20.07.2023.
 *
 * Interface for saving the state of the dialog between the user and the bot.
 * Dialogs are separated by chat and by the user who wrote the message.
 *
 * This means that one user will have different dialogs in different chats.
 * And it means that in a group chat each user will have a different dialog.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If update without from.id, it will be ignored in any dialogs (BotHandling).
